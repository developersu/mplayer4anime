### License

Source code spreads under the GNU General Public License v.3. You can find it in LICENSE file.

Note: Since 0.10 application supports playlists management and implements own json-based format that (somehow) could be used in third-party application,
it would be nice to leave it as is. At least, I would prefer to have .alpr file extension used for this. As for the format of playlist, please
refer to WFTPL license.
